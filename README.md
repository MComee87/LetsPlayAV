# Let's Play AV
Neighborhood Map project for Udacity FullStack

This project uses Google Maps, KnockoutJS, Bootstrap and JQuery. 

This project shows the location of places in the Antelope Valley where families can participate in fun activities. Clicking on a location brings up a marker with information from Foursquare. 
In the upper right hand corner of the page is the current temperature from Weather Underground.


## How to run
